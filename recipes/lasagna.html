    <h1>The best Lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="./gettyimages-168246587-612x612.jpg" alt="lasagna">
   <h2>Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese</h2>
   <p>This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne by the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce, with a few tweaks inspired by locals—adjusting the meat, wine, and whether to add milk. One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential. The ragù is simple, with no garlic, herbs, or spices. Fresh pasta eliminates the need for pre-boiling.
